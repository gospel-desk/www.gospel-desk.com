<section>
    <p>Jesus of Nazareth is a key figure in human culture, generating many, many
    interpretations of his significance. Was he God? Our greatest spiritual
    teacher? A lesser prophet? A mystic? A healer?  Is he, for better or worse, a
    figment of imagination? What, if anything, does he mean for our own lives, for
    our communities, our countries, and our civilization?</p>

    <p>The four Gospels of Mark, Matthew, Luke, and John are our best primary
    sources of information about Jesus, giving us four distinct yet related
    perspectives on his life. The Gospels are usually embedded in the New Testament
    of the Christian Bible, which gives them additional context at the cost of
    accessiblity. Here they are offered in a unique edition that emphasizes their
    narrative structure, and Jesus' singular place in human culture. Read the
    Gospels for yourself. Reach your own conclusions. Read them together with
    others, and determine what his significance might be for the communities to
    which you belong.</p>

                <p>Jesus of Nazareth is a key figure in human culture, generating
                many, many interpretations of his significance. Was he God? Our
                greatest spiritual teacher? A lesser prophet? A mystic? A healer?
                Is he, for better or worse, a figment of imagination? What, if
                anything, does he mean for our own lives, for our communities, our
                countries, and our civilization?</p>

                <p>The four Gospels of Mark, Matthew, Luke, and John are our best
                primary sources of information about Jesus, giving us four distinct
                yet related perspectives on his life. The Gospels are usually
                embedded in the New Testament of the Christian Bible, which gives
                them additional context at the cost of accessiblity. Here they are
                offered in a unique edition that emphasizes their narrative
                structure, and Jesus' singular place in human culture. Read the
                Gospels for yourself. Reach your own conclusions. Read them
                together with others, and determine what his significance might be
                for the communities to which you belong.</p>

                    <h2>The Twelve Believers</h2>
                    <h3>Venerating those Christ venerates</h3>
                </a>
                <ul>
                    <li>In Progress</li>

                </ul>

                <p>In the four Gospels, there are twelve people whom Christ
                directly, explicitly praises for their faith. Just as Jesus calls
                the Twelve Disciples to establish a pattern of discipleship for the
                Church, so also there are Twelve Believers who call on Jesus in a
                way that provides a clear picture of devotion for all Christians to
                follow.</p>

                <p>The purpose of the Twelve Believers project is to promote the
                veneration of the Twelve Believers as saints of the Church, for we
                should surely venerate those whom Christ Himself venerates. In the
                first phase of the project, Gospel Desk is commissioning icons of
                the Twelve Believers, each from a different iconographer.</p>

                    <h2>A Narrative Apparatus</h2>
                    <h3>Cataloging characters and scenes</h3>
                </a>
                <ul>
                    <li>In Progress</li>
                    <li><a href="https://github.com/gospel-desk/a-narrative-apparatus">GitHub</a></li>
                </ul>

                <p>This project is a follow-up to <i>The Gospels</i> (2012), which
                lays out Mark, Matthew, Luke, and John in a readerly fashion, to
                make their narrative force more immediate. Now for the opposite: to
                render the narrative structure of the Gospels in systematic
                definitude.</p>

                <p>The basis for the project is the SBLGNT critical text (probably
                in its MorphGNT variant). There are two tasks:</p>

                <ol>
                    <li>Catalog, taxonomically, all of the characters in the Gospels.</li>
                    <li>Sequentially relate all of the verbs in the Gospels,
                        according to a scale of space and time.</li>
                </ol>

                <p>The result will be an exhaustive dataset that will provide
                the foundation for many fruitful analyses, such as <i>The
                Twelve Believers</i>.</p>

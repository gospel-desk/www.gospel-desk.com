[The Gospels](/the-gospels) lays out Mark, Matthew, Luke, and John in a way
that is easy to read, to make their narrative force more immediate. <cite>The
Gospels, with a Narrative Apparatus</cite> has an opposite goal: to render the
narrative structure of the Gospels systematically and definitively, in both
print and digital editions.

The three primary prerequisite tasks apparent so far are:

1. Catalog, taxonomically, all of the characters.

1. Identify all of the different story frames.

1. Sequentially relate all of the verbs, according to a scale of space and
   time, in order to determine the scenes.

I am writing [specialized software](/updates/2020/the-abstractinator/) to aid
in compiling this information. Lord willing, the result will be an exhaustive
dataset that will provide the foundation for many fruitful analyses, such as
[The Twelve Believers](/the-twelve-believers/).

[The Gospels](/the-gospels) lays out Mark, Matthew, Luke, and John in a
readerly fashion, to make their narrative force more immediate. Now for the
opposite: to render the narrative structure of the Gospels in systematic
definitude.

Our basis is the [SBLGNT](http://sblgnt.com/) critical text, probably in its
[MorphGNT](https://github.com/morphgnt/sblgnt) variant. There are two tasks:

1. Catalog, taxonomically, all of the characters in the Gospels.

1. Sequentially relate all of the verbs in the Gospels, according to a scale of
   space and time.

The result will be an exhaustive dataset that will provide the foundation for
many fruitful analyses, such as [The Twelve Believers](/the-twelve-believers/).

### In the Gospels

#### John 1:45-51

Philip found Nathanael, and said to him, We have found him, of whom Moses in
the law, and the prophets, wrote: Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.

Nathanael said to him, Can any good thing come out of Nazareth?

Philip said to him, Come and see.

Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him, and said about him, <u>Behold, an Israelite
indeed, in whom is no deceit!</u>

Nathanael said to him, How do you know me?

Jesus answered him, Before Philip called you, when you were under the fig tree,
I saw you.

Nathanael answered him, Rabbi, you are the Son of God! You are King of Israel!

Jesus answered him, Because I told you, I saw you underneath the fig tree, do
you believe? You will see greater things than these! He said to him, Most
certainly, I tell you, hereafter you will see heaven opened, and the angels of
God ascending and descending on the Son of Man.

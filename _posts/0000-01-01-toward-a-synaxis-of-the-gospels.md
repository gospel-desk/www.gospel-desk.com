title: Toward a Synaxis of the Gospels
excerpt: I made a drawing of all the individuals in the Gospels, arranged hierarchically.
---

In my first post I shared the story of how I finally came around to Orthodoxy
after several decades of [studying the
Gospels](/2024/welcome-to-gospel-desk/#the-role-of-gospel-desk-in-my-conversion).
I had considered the question of how to live my life from the perspective of
its end: the dread judgement seat of Christ. Reading the Gospels through this
lens, I discovered [St. Justa](/the-twelve-faithful-servants/st-justa/), and
then the rest of the [Twelve Faithful
Servants](/the-twelve-faithful-servants/).

Following the ripples further, I've since asked: who are _all_ the individuals
in the Gospels, and how do they relate to Christ? For surely Christ is the
center of the Gospels, as He is the center of the whole cosmos, and of our own
lives. I want to see this more clearly, so I made a drawing of all the
individuals in the Gospels, arranged hierarchically.

The occasion was the invitation of a friend to add a page to a notebook of
poems, artwork, recipes, reminiscences, and so forth. I drew this in my first
year after chrismation, on December 13, 2022. I offer it here not with any
finality, but rather as a starting point, a suggestion to others more
knowledgeable than I in the Scriptures and the Church's cosmology, or more
skilled in art (the bar is low, friends). What is missing or misplaced? What
future iconography might this inspire?

I titled the drawing, "Synaxis of the Gospels." Maybe there is a better name. I
had in mind icons such as the [Synaxis of the Saints of North
America](https://www.oca.org/saints/lives/2017/06/18/49-synaxis-of-the-saints-of-north-america)
and the [Synaxis of the Archangel Michael and the Other Bodiless
Powers](https://www.oca.org/saints/lives/2024/11/08/103244-synaxis-of-the-archangel-michael-and-the-other-bodiless-powers).

The center of the cosmic hierarchy we find in the Gospels is our God and
Savior, **Jesus Christ**, and He is at the center of my composition. The
**Father** is shown at upper right, hand outstretched in blessing. Maybe in
iconography that is supposed to be Christ's hand? I don't know. It appears in
the icon of the [Sinful Woman Forgiven by
Christ](/the-twelve-faithful-servants/the-sinful-woman/). In including it in my
drawing, I had in mind the Voice from Heaven at Christ's Baptism, His
Transfiguration, and the Coming of the Hour. The **Holy Spirit** descends in
the form of a dove as at the Baptism.

Christ came not to bring peace but a sword, to separate out those who believe
in Him from those who do not. In my drawing I represent this fundamental
division with the sweeping curve of the **Seventy Apostles**. Within the arc
they describe is the Kingdom, united with the angelic host and indwelt by God.
Beyond are those who have placed themselves outside, under the sway of
**Satan**. This defines the basic structure of the composition.

### In the Kingdom

I arranged the individuals within the Kingdom in seven groups, according to the
measure of their faith as recorded in the Gospels. This can be seen as loosely
related to the proskomedia, adapted for the specific individuals we find in the
Gospels.

1. The **Deisis**: Christ Himself; the Virgin Mary, Mother of God; and St. John the Forerunner
1. The **Predecessors** of Christ, such as Righteous Joseph, and Righteous Simeon and
   Prophetess Anna
1. The **Twelve Apostles**.
1. The **Myrrh-bearing Women**.
1. The **Faithful Servants**, those whom Christ [explicitly, directly
   praises](/the-twelve-faithful-servants/) for their faith
1. Those whose faith is **clear**, though not explicitly, directly praised;
   for example, St. Photini, the Woman at the Well
1. Those whose faith can be **assumed**, though it is not emphasized by the Evangelists, such as the Woman
   Caught in Adultery

There are many wonderful interrelations among these people to explore,
especially among those in the first five groups. Peter and Andrew are brothers.
Peter is an Apostle and also a Faithful Servant. Peter, James, and John are
witnesses to the Transfiguration together. Mary, Martha, and Lazarus of Bethany
are siblings with a close friendship with the Lord. Mary and Martha are
Myrrh-bearers. Mary is a Faithful Servant—the only one praised twice. And so
forth.

I represented children throughout this portion of the drawing, some with their
parents who approach Christ for healing, others gathered directly before
Christ. They are closer almost than the members of the Deisis. "Suffer little
children, and forbid them not, to come unto me: for of such is the Kingdom of
Heaven."

### Outside

Immediately outside the Kingdom I represented those particular elements of the
natural world that appear in the Gospel stories, such as the wind and the
waves, and the fig tree. Further beyond are the crowds, some individuals of
whom are distinguishable, heckling Christ at various points. At the bottom of
the picture is the outer darkness, reminiscent of the lower portion of the
Golgotha and Resurrection icons. Here we find Satan, the demons, and those such
as Herod and Judas who gave themselves over to him. Lord have mercy.

### Map and Tree

I think of the Synaxis of the Gospels drawing as a map of sorts. When I hear a
particular story of an encounter with Christ, I can ask, "Where does this fit?"
It is also a family tree. The individuals in the Synaxis of the Gospels are the
seed of the Church—the Apostles, yes, heading up _all_ the faithful. They
number approximately 144, a beautiful counterpoint to the 144,000 we find at
the end, in the Revelation.

We have some groups represented in the abstract, but as with an icon, this
drawing (which is not itself an icon) emphasizes the individuality of the people
represented. These are hypostases, and I included a key on the verso in my
friend's notebook. I did, however, accidentally leave some people out. Moses
and Elijah should be with the predecessors, as should the Magi and Shepherds.
Let me know if you find others missing.

My hope is that this drawing can help us become more familiar with the Gospels,
and see more clearly the saints we find there. May God count us worthy of being
found in His Holy Church today!

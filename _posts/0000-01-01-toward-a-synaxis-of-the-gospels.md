title: Toward a Synaxis of the Gospels
excerpt: I made a drawing of all the people in the Gospels, arranged hierarchically.
---

As I've read the Gospels over the years, I've wanted to know: who are all the
people in the Gospels? How do they relate to Christ? For surely Christ is the
center of the Gospels, as He is the center of the whole cosmos, and of our own
lives. I want to see this more clearly, so I made a drawing of all the people in
the Gospels, arranged hierarchically.

The occasion was the invitation of a friend to add a page to a notebook of
poems, artwork, recipes, reminiscences, and so forth. I offer it here not
as any sort of final word, but rather as a suggestion to others more
knowledgeable than I in the Scriptures and the Church's cosmology, or more
skilled in art (the bar is low, friends). What is missing or misplaced? What
future iconography might this inspire?

I titled the drawing, "Synaxis of the Gospels." The people are grouped as
follows:

1. [In the Kingdom](#in-the-kingdom)
    1. [Holy Trinity](#holy-trinity)
    1. [Angels](#angels)
    1. [Predecessors](#predecessors)
    1. [Deisis](#deisis)
    1. [Twelve Apostles](#twelve-apostles)
    1. [Myrrh-bearers](#myrrh-bearing-women)
    1. [Faithful Servants](#faithful-servants)
    1. [Followers](#followers)
    1. [Onlookers](#onlookers)
    1. [Children](#children)
    1. [Seventy Apostles](#seventy-apostles)
1. [Outside](#outside)
    1. [Crowds](#crowds)
    1. [Nature](#nature)
    1. [Opponents](#opponents)

### Kingdom

The center of the cosmic hierarchy we find in the Gospels is our God and
Savior, Jesus Christ. He came not to bring peace but a sword, to separate out
those who believe in Him from those who do not. In my drawing I represent this
fundamental division with the sweeping curve of the Seventy Apostles. Inside
the arc they describe are those within the Kingdom, beyond are those who have
placed themselves outside.

### Holy Trinity

<div class="clear"></div>

**God the Father** is shown at upper right, hand outstretched in blessing.
Maybe in iconography that is supposed to be Christ's hand? I don't know. It
appears in the icon of the [Sinful Woman Forgiven by
Christ](/the-twelve-faithful-servants/the-sinful-woman/). In including it in my
drawing, I had in mind the Voice from Heaven at Christ's Baptism, His
Transfiguration, and the Coming of the Hour. **God the Son** is the
center of the composition, with **God the Holy Spirit** in the form of a dove
descending from heaven as at the Baptism.

You'll notice I did not attempt eyes on any of the figures. This is a sketch,
not an icon.

### Angels

<div class="detail"><img src="angels.webp"></div>

At the top of the drawing is the **angelic host** that appears at the Nativity.
They are arrayed behind Christ, offset just below the Father, and with the Holy
Spirit as a dove passing through their midst. Three specific angels are depicted,
signifying:

- **Archangel Gabriel**, who announced the Incarnation to the Mother of God;
- the **angel who appeared to Joseph** in his dreams (this wasn't also Gabriel,
  was it?); and
- the **angels at the tomb** (it was two, right?).

I'm not sure how the Church identifies these angels. Perhaps the drawing should
show two or four instead of three.

### Deisis

<div class="detail"><img src="deisis.webp"></div>

The center of the drawing is **Jesus Christ**, our God and Savior. He is
flanked in the traditional deisis by the **Virgin Mary**, His Most-Pure Mother,
Joseph’s wife and **John the Forerunner**, His second cousin, son of Elizabeth
and Zechariah.

### Predecessors

<div class="detail"><img src="predecessors.webp"></div>

Behind the deisis stand the predecessors of Christ.

- Behind Mary: **Joseph** and the faithful step-brothers of Christ, **James**
  and **Joses**, who repented of their initial disbelief and were numbered
  among the Seventy.
- Behind Christ Himself: **Simeon** and **Anna**.
- Behind John: his parents, **Elizabeth** and **Zachariah**.

Missing from this tier are the **Shepherds** and the **Magi**. I would now
include **Moses** and **Elijah** here as well, from the Transfiguration.


### Exemplars

Standing immediately before the deisis are three groups of exemplary saints:
the Twelve Apostles, the Seven Myrrh-bearing Women, and the Twelve Faithful
Servants. There is some overlap between these groups.

<div class="detail"><img src="exemplars.webp"></div>


### Twelve Apostles

From His many disciples, Christ appoints Seventy Apostles to go before Him, and
Twelve Apostles to go with Him. Six of the Twelve are sets of brothers.

- **Simon Peter** and his brother **Andrew**, the first-called
- **James** and **John the Theologian**, sons of Zebedee and Salome, Sons of Thunder
- **James**, son of Alphaeus and his brother **Matthew**, the tax collector, called Levi
- **Philip**, who said “Come and see” to **Nathanael**, also called Bartholomew
- **Thomas**, who touched the Lord’s side
- **Thaddaeus**, also called Jude (or Judas)
- **Simon**, the Canaanite, the Zealot

Judas Iscariot betrays him. The Apostles as a group abandon Christ in His
Passion, and several have weak moments individually. Peter denies Christ three
times, wavers in the waves, and even tempts Christ. Thomas withholds belief
until he has seen. The sons of Zebedee, prompted by their mother Salome, ask to
sit at His right hand, provoking the indignation of the ten. Another time they
ask to call down fire from heaven, and are rebuked. Yet Christ restores Peter,
appears to Thomas, and manifests His glory to James and John with Peter at the
Transfiguration.

### Myrrh-bearing Women

We should also praise and emulate the seven holy Myrrh-bearers.

- Mary, the Mother of God
- Mary Magdalene, who had seven demons
- Joanna, the wife of Chuza, Herod's steward
- Salome, the wife of Zebedee
- Mary, the wife of Cleopas
- Susanna, patron of Christ
- Mary and Martha of Bethany


### Faithful Servants

The Twelve Apostles are called by Christ. The Twelve Faithful Servants, on the other
hand, call on Christ, and are met with His praise for their faith.

The Defiant
- Justa, the Canaanite woman
- Veronica, the woman with a flow of blood
- The Sinful Woman, forgiven by Christ

The Outcast
- Dysmas (Rakh), the penitent thief
- The Samaritan Leper
- Bartimaeus, the blind beggar

The Powerful
- The Centurion
- Zacchaeus, the son of Abraham
- The Wise Scribe

The Familiar
- Nathanael (Bartholomew), the true Israelite
- Peter, the blessed
- Mary of Bethany, the twice-praised

The Twelve Faithful Servants come from all walks of life—rich and poor, weak and
powerful, men and women, Jews and Gentiles, sick and healthy, friends and
strangers, in families and alone, sinful and pious. Some struggle against the
crowd, some are their own worst enemy, some approach Christ easily. There is
someone for everyone. Read their stories and ask God to help you make a special
connection with one or two of them. They show us most clearly what it means to
respond to Christ’s claim of allegiance on our lives. Twelve Faithful Servants, pray to
Christ our God for us, that He would help our unbelief!

### Followers

<div class="detail"><img src="followers.webp"></div>

There are 19 other clear models of faith.

- The Poor Widow, who gives the mite
- The four Friends of the Paralytic, lowering him down
- Photini, the woman at the well

Healed Worshippers

- Jairus, believing in Christ to heal his daughter
- Peter’s mother-in-law, who serves Christ
- The Blind-born, witness before the Pharisees
- The Epileptic’s Father, “Help my unbelief!”
- The Gadarene, clothed and in his right mind
- The Infirm Woman, afflicted for eighteen years

In and After His Passion

- Procla, wife of Pilate
- Simon of Cyrene, who bears His Cross
- Longinus, the Centurion at the Cross
- Nicodemus and Joseph of Arimethea
- Cleopas and Luke on the road to Emmaus

### Children

- The Lad with the loaves and fishes
- The Child He sets in their midst
- The Children brought to Him

### The Seventy

### Onlookers

There are ten others whom Jesus heals or saves. Their stories focus on the
mercy of God, the amazement of the crowd, or the offense taken by the Pharisees
and the scribes, with no mention of the faith of the person being healed or
saved. Yet there are many we can identify with here.

- The Woman Caught in Adultery, “Sin no more”
- The Paralytic at Bethesda pool, “Sin no more”
- The Widow of Nain and her son
- A Leper who moves Christ to pity (then gabs)
- A Man with a Withered Hand
- A Dumb Demoniac
- A Deaf Mute from Decapolis
- A Man with Dropsy
- Malchus, the High Priest’s servant

### Crowds

Jesus does have compassion on the crowd, but He also rues their lukewarm faith,
and dismisses their heckling. “Whoever does the will of God is my brother, and
sister, and mother.” “Blessed rather are those who hear the word of God and
keep it!” “Leave the dead to bury their own dead.”

### Nature

### Opponents

The rich and powerful He outright provokes: Herod the Tetrarch (“that fox”),
his court, Philip and Herodias and their daughter, Pilate, the Roman soldiers,
the moneychangers in the temple, Annas, Caiaphas the High Priest, the chief
priests and the Council, the Pharisees and scribes, the Sadducees, the rulers
of the synagogues and the elders of the people. He came to set fire to the
earth! The Rich Young Ruler goes away sad, yet we do also have clear proofs
that all things are indeed possible with God—even the salvation of the rich.

<div class="tldr"><span>👉</span>From here down is scraps and fragments from previous
documents, to be incorporated above.</div>

#### Core

Nine individuals form the core of the Church in the Gospels, counting Christ
Himself, Who is the Head of the Church. We should especially venerate, honor,
and emulate these saints in virtue and in worship of Christ our God together
with His All-Holy Father and Life-giving Spirit.

#### The Inner Circle

Three Apostles were witnesses of the Transfiguration:

**Peter**, chief Apostle, confessor of Christ, and brother of Andrew the
first-called; business partners with James and John

**James** and **John**, sons of Zebedee and Salome, Sons of Thunder. John is also the Beloved Disciple, the Theologian and Evangelist(!)

#### The Close Friends of Christ

**Mary**, **Martha**, and **Lazarus** of Bethany.

Of those who encounter Christ in His youth, we should honor nine individuals and two small groups of individuals.

1. Mary, the Mother of God
1. Joseph, the foster-father of Christ
1. James and Joses, step-brothers of the Lord
1. Elizabeth, mother of John, cousin of Virgin Mary
1. Zechariah, after he is restored to speech
1. John the Forerunner and Baptist
1. Simeon and Anna
1. The Shepherds
1. The Magi

Herod the King slaughters the Holy Innocents. The teachers in the temple who
encounter the twelve- year-old Christ recognize His wisdom, but their exchange
foreshadows the conflict leading to His Crucifixion. The Lord had step-sisters
as well as step-brothers, James, Jude, Simon, and Joses. We hear that His
brothers are disbelieving, but James and Joses do go on to join the Seventy.



We should read the lives of the saints, especially our North American saints.
We should read and study the whole Bible. We should pray the Psalms. But we
should treasure the Holy Gospels even moreso. We should venerate the Synaxis of
the Gospels. May God count us worthy of being found in His Holy Church today!

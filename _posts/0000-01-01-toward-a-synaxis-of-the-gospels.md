title: Toward a Synaxis of the Gospels
excerpt: I made a drawing of all the people in the Gospels, arranged hierarchically.
---

In my first post I shared the story of how I came around to Orthodoxy [through
study of the
Gospels](/2024/welcome-to-gospel-desk/#the-role-of-gospel-desk-in-my-conversion)
over several decades. I considered the question of how to live my life from the
perspective of its end: the dread judgement seat of Christ. Reading the Gospels
through this lens, I discovered in the Gospels first [St.
Justa](/the-twelve-faithful-servants/st-justa/), and then the whole [Twelve
Faithful Servants](/the-twelve-faithful-servants/).

Continuing on from there, I've wanted to know: who are _all_ the people in the
Gospels, and how do they relate to Christ? For surely Christ is the center of
the Gospels, as He is the center of the whole cosmos, and of our own lives. I
want to see this more clearly, so I made a drawing of all the people in the
Gospels, arranged hierarchically.

The occasion was the invitation of a friend to add a page to a notebook of
poems, artwork, recipes, reminiscences, and so forth. I offer it here not as
any sort of final word, but rather as a starting point, a suggestion to others
more knowledgeable than I in the Scriptures and the Church's cosmology, or more
skilled in art (the bar is low, friends). What is missing or misplaced? What
future iconography might this inspire?

I titled the drawing, "Synaxis of the Gospels." Maybe there is a better name. I
had in mind icons such as the [Synaxis of the Saints of North
America](https://www.oca.org/saints/lives/2017/06/18/49-synaxis-of-the-saints-of-north-america)
and the [Synaxis of the Archangel Michael and the Other Bodiless
Powers](https://www.oca.org/saints/lives/2024/11/08/103244-synaxis-of-the-archangel-michael-and-the-other-bodiless-powers).

The center of the cosmic hierarchy we find in the Gospels is our God and
Savior, **Jesus Christ**, and He is at the center of my composition. The
**Father** is shown at upper right, hand outstretched in blessing. Maybe in
iconography that is supposed to be Christ's hand? I don't know. It appears in
the icon of the [Sinful Woman Forgiven by
Christ](/the-twelve-faithful-servants/the-sinful-woman/). In including it in my
drawing, I had in mind the Voice from Heaven at Christ's Baptism, His
Transfiguration, and the Coming of the Hour. The **Holy Spirit** descends in
the form of a dove as at the Baptism.

Christ came not to bring peace but a sword, to separate out those who believe
in Him from those who do not. In my drawing I represent this fundamental
division with the sweeping curve of the **Seventy Apostles**. Within the arc
they describe is the Kingdom, united with the angelic host and indwelt by God.
Beyond are those who have placed themselves outside, under the sway of
**Satan**. This defines the basic structure of the composition.

I arranged the individuals within the Kingdom in seven groups, according to
the measure of their faith:

1. The **Deisis**: Christ Himself, the Virgin Mary, and John the Forerunner.
1. The **Predecessors** of Christ, such as Righteous Joseph, and Simeon and
   Anna.
   1. The **Twelve Apostles**. 
   1. The **Myrrh-bearing Women**. 
   1. The **Faithful Servants**, those whom Christ [explicitly, directly
   praises](/the-twelve-faithful-servants/) for their faith.
   1. Those whose faith is **clear**, though not explicitly, directly praised.
   for example, St. Photini, the Woman at the Well.
   1. Those whose faith is **likely**, though not emphasized, such as the Woman
   Caught in Adultery.

Immediately outside the Kingdom I represented those particular elements of the
natural world that appear in the Gospel stories, such as the wind and the
waves, and the fig tree. Further beyond are the crowds, some individuals of
whom are distinguishable, heckling Christ at various points. At the bottom of
the picture is the outer darkness, reminiscent of the lower portion of the
Golgotha and Resurrection icons. Here we find Satan, his demons, and those who
give themselves over to him, including Herod and Judas. Lord have mercy.

Overlap.

Children.

I included a key on the page opposite. Here are some I know to be missing:

- Moses and Elijah, should be with the predecessors. Magi and Shepherds.
- Heard of swine with the natural world.

### Children

- The Lad with the loaves and fishes
- The Child He sets in their midst
- The Children brought to Him

### Nature

### Opponents

The rich and powerful He outright provokes: Herod the Tetrarch (‚Äúthat fox‚Äù),
his court, Philip and Herodias and their daughter, Pilate, the Roman soldiers,
the moneychangers in the temple, Annas, Caiaphas the High Priest, the chief
priests and the Council, the Pharisees and scribes, the Sadducees, the rulers
of the synagogues and the elders of the people. He came to set fire to the
earth! The Rich Young Ruler goes away sad, yet we do also have clear proofs
that all things are indeed possible with God‚Äîeven the salvation of the rich.

#### Core

Nine individuals form the core of the Church in the Gospels, counting Christ
Himself, Who is the Head of the Church. We should especially venerate, honor,
and emulate these saints in virtue and in worship of Christ our God together
with His All-Holy Father and Life-giving Spirit.

#### The Inner Circle

Three Apostles were witnesses of the Transfiguration:

**Peter**, chief Apostle, confessor of Christ, and brother of Andrew the
first-called; business partners with James and John

**James** and **John**, sons of Zebedee and Salome, Sons of Thunder. John is also the Beloved Disciple, the Theologian and Evangelist(!)

#### The Close Friends of Christ

**Mary**, **Martha**, and **Lazarus** of Bethany.

Of those who encounter Christ in His youth, we should honor nine individuals and two small groups of individuals.

1. Mary, the Mother of God
1. Joseph, the foster-father of Christ
1. James and Joses, step-brothers of the Lord
1. Elizabeth, mother of John, cousin of Virgin Mary
1. Zechariah, after he is restored to speech
1. John the Forerunner and Baptist
1. Simeon and Anna
1. The Shepherds
1. The Magi


We should read the lives of the saints, especially our North American saints.
We should read and study the whole Bible. We should pray the Psalms. But we
should treasure the Holy Gospels even moreso. We should venerate the Synaxis of
the Gospels. May God count us worthy of being found in His Holy Church today!

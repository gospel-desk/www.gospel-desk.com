God became incarnate in Jesus Christ, and so it seems right to me that Gospel
Desk should also be incarnate—a *place* for *people* well before it is a social
media brand.

Last year, God blessed our family with a remarkable property on the edge of
Sewickley, Pennsylvania, on a hill called Spring Hill. The property is in two
parcels, each with a house on it. Our family lives in 980 Crescent Avenue. 981
is Gospel Desk headquarters.

#### Perched Between Village and Forest 

Gospel Desk HQ at 981 Crescent represents the external and the public—the
published, even (here we are)—in contrast to the internal, private sphere of
our family's home next door. But that's just the beginning of its symbolic
meaning.

Down the valley through the trees you can spy the clock tower on the Methodist
church at the center of the village. Rising behind us is a hundred-acre wood.
Gospel Desk symbolically occupies the boundary between civilization and wild,
known and unknown, order and chaos, structure and freedom, conformity and
individuality, unity and multiplicity. It is a threshold, a portal, a gateway.

Despite being close to the village, the property is difficult to get to.
Crescent Avenue is not terribly long, but it is narrow, winding, and sliding
down the hill, taking some houses with it. Gospel Desk is at the end. The
property has a feeling of isolation, almost otherworldliness. It's a bit of a
monastery in the sky.

The building itself has not been lived in for decades. There are no utility
lines left, let alone active service. When we took ownership (stewardship, I
prefer), three fully rusted acetylene tanks(!) occupied the porch. Junk filled
the upstairs and downright rubble the downstairs. I shoveled out 50 bags of
former plaster and about as much dryrotten flooring to reveal a clean crack in
the foundation that explains the back wall's unsettling lean. It's not clear to
what extent the building can be saved. The detached garage *did* collapse, long
ago, and now cat litter and yard waste fill the spot. Here, then, is another
aspect of Gospel Desk's meaning: [I'm working on a
building](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I%27m_Working_on_a_Building)!

#### Head, Heart, and Hospitality

In the opening chapter of *The Abolition of Man*, C.S. Lewis summarizes an
ancient anthropology: "The head rules the belly through the chest." I see in
this a pattern for what Gospel Desk headquarters could become, if the Lord
wills it: a library and a chapel upstairs, living quarters downstairs. Maybe
some day you will join us here for a retreat, enjoying this special spot with
us, studying and meditating on the Gospels, and drawing closer to God.

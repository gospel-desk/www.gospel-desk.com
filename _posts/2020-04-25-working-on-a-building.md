As I reach out to [artists](/updates/2020/first-three-iconographers/) to
collaborate on iconography for the [Twelve Believers](/the-twelve-believers/)
project, we are starting to confront the question of the architectural and
liturgical context that the icons will ultimately inhabit. My hope is that they
will live in a chapel—the Chapel of the Faithful Servant—within a guest house
on our family's property. I think it will add a lot to include this as part of
the Gospel Desk story, so in this post I want to introduce you to the guest
house and its situation.


#### Perched Between Village and Forest

Last year, God blessed our family with a remarkable property on the edge of
Sewickley, Pennsylvania, on a hill called Spring Hill. The property is in two
parcels, each with a house on it. Our family lives in one. Lord willing, we'll
be able to develop the other into a guest house that in some measure can serve
as a physical home for Gospel Desk.

Compared to the internal, private sphere of our family's home next door, the
guest house represents a more external and public aspect. But that's just the
beginning of its symbolic meaning.

Down the valley through the trees I can glimpse the Methodists' clock tower at
the center of the village. Rising behind us is a hundred-acre wood. Our
property symbolically occupies the boundary between civilization and wild,
known and unknown, order and chaos, structure and freedom, conformity and
individuality, unity and multiplicity. It is a threshold, a portal, a gateway.
Moreover, despite our proximity to the village, the property is difficult to
get to. The road we live on is not terribly long, but it is narrow, winding,
and sliding down the hill. Some houses are sliding with it. We're at the end,
giving the property a feeling of isolation, almost otherworldliness. It's a bit
of a monastery in the sky, a place to detach and recenter, but also to pray for
the bustling world below, which I am bound to re-enter. God invites me, here on
the symbolic edge of a civilization in which I am the main character in my own
story, to inhabit the [story](/updates/2020/introducing-gospel-desk/) of which
_he_ is the main character—thanks be to God!

The guest house building itself has not been occupied for decades. The utility
lines are long gone. When we took ownership (stewardship, I prefer), three
fully rusted acetylene tanks(!) occupied the porch. Junk filled the upstairs
and downright rubble the downstairs. I shoveled out 50 bags of former plaster
and about as much dryrotten flooring to reveal a clean crack in the foundation
that explains the back wall's unsettling lean.  It's not actually clear to what
extent the building can be saved. The detached garage *did* collapse, long ago,
and now cat litter and yard waste fill the spot. Here, then, is the plain
meaning behind Gospel Desk's motto, [I'm working on a
building](/working-on-a-building/)!


#### Head, Heart, and Hospitality

In the opening chapter of *The Abolition of Man*, C.S. Lewis summarizes an
ancient anthropology: "The head rules the belly through the chest." I see in
this a pattern for what the guest house at Spring Hill can become, if the Lord
wills it: a library and a chapel upstairs, living quarters downstairs. Maybe
some day you will be able to visit, studying in the library with the [Narrative
Apparatus](/a-narrative-apparatus), praying in the chapel with the [Twelve
Believers](/the-twelve-believers/), enjoying this special spot with us, and
recentering your life within God's story.

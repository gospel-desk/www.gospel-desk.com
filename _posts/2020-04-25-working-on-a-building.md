Last year, God blessed our family with a remarkable property on the edge of
Sewickley, Pennsylvania, on a hill called Spring Hill. The property is in two
parcels, each with a house on it. Our family lives in one. Lord willing, we'll
be able to develop the other into a guest house, and Gospel Desk can have a
physical home there.

#### Perched Between Village and Forest 

Compared to the internal, private sphere of our family's home next door, the
guest house represents the external and the publicâ€”the published, even (here we
are). But that's just the beginning of its symbolic meaning.

Down the valley through the trees you can glimpse the Methodists' clock tower
at the center of the village. Rising behind us is a hundred-acre wood. Our
property symbolically occupies the boundary between civilization and wild,
known and unknown, order and chaos, structure and freedom, conformity and
individuality, unity and multiplicity. It is a threshold, a portal, a gateway.

Yet despite its proximity to the village, the property is difficult to get to.
The road we live on is not terribly long, but it is narrow, winding, and
sliding down the hill. Some houses are sliding with it. We're at the end. The
property has a feeling of isolation, almost otherworldliness. It's a bit of a
monastery in the sky.

The guest house building itself has not been lived in for decades. There are no
utility lines left, let alone active service. When we took ownership
(stewardship, I prefer), three fully rusted acetylene tanks(!) occupied the
porch. Junk filled the upstairs and downright rubble the downstairs. I shoveled
out 50 bags of former plaster and about as much dryrotten flooring to reveal a
clean crack in the foundation that explains the back wall's unsettling lean.
It's not actually clear to what extent the building can be saved. The detached
garage *did* collapse, long ago, and now cat litter and yard waste fill the
spot. Here, then, is a layer of meaning in Gospel Desk's motto, [I'm
working on a building](/working-on-a-building/)!


#### Head, Heart, and Hospitality

In the opening chapter of *The Abolition of Man*, C.S. Lewis summarizes an
ancient anthropology: "The head rules the belly through the chest." I see in
this a pattern for what the guest house at Spring Hill can become, if the Lord
wills it: a library and a chapel upstairs, living quarters downstairs. Maybe
some day you will be able to visit, studying in the library with the [Narrative
Apparatus](/a-narrative-apparatus), praying in the chapel with the [Twelve
Believers](/the-twelve-believers/), enjoying this special spot with us, and
drawing closer to God.

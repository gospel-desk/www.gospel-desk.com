title: Toward a Synaxis of the Gospels
excerpt: I made a drawing of all the individuals in the Gospels, arranged hierarchically. Could this be a new icon?
---

I have an idea for an icon, which I am calling the "Synaxis of the Gospels." I am
not aware that such an icon exists. If so, please [let me
know](mailto:chad@zetaweb.com). In this post I share the story of how I came to
find this idea. Then I present a simple sketch of what such an icon might
look like, and some initial thoughts on its structure.

My purpose in publishing this idea for a Synaxis of the Gospels icon is to
offer it to the Church for consideration. Maybe it's a good idea, maybe it's a
bad idea. I need your help to know. The potential value, if this be genuine, is
in having another means of seeing Christ at the center of all things, and of
better knowing those who knew Christ on earth. I believe they stand ready
to help us deepen our worship of Christ our true God in our own time, to orient
our own lives around Him.

### How I Found the Idea

In my [first post](/2024/welcome-to-gospel-desk/), I shared the story of how I
finally came around to Orthodoxy after several decades of [studying the
Gospels](/2024/welcome-to-gospel-desk/#the-role-of-gospel-desk-in-my-conversion).
I had considered the question of how to live my life from the perspective of
its end: the dread judgement seat of Christ. Reading the Gospels through this
lens, I discovered [St. Justa](/the-twelve-faithful-servants/st-justa/), and
then the rest of the [Twelve Faithful
Servants](/the-twelve-faithful-servants/).

The wider question was: who are _all_ the individuals in the Gospels, and how do
they relate to Christ? For surely Christ is the center of the Gospels, as He is
the center of the whole cosmos, and of our own lives. I did a study on this in 2008.

My particular interest was to distinguish the _individuals_ whom Christ
interacts with in the Gospels from the _groups_ with whom He interacts. While I
myself inhabit several group identities, I exist before God first as a unique
individual. I wanted to better understand my own relationship with God by
meditating on the Gospel record of His interactions with individuals _as
individuals_. This led me in 2008 to an appreciation for [St. Justa, the
Canaanite Woman](http://localhost:4000/the-twelve-faithful-servants/st-justa/). Revisiting this question in 2018 led me to recognize and name the
[Twelve Faithful Servants](/the-twelve-faithful-servants/).

In 2022, a friend invited me to add a page to a notebook of poems, artwork,
recipes, reminiscences, and so forth. This was in the first year after my
chrismation. I decided to use the opportunity to make a drawing of all the
distinct individuals in the Gospels, according to the Church's understanding as
best I could determine it. I fulfilled the request on December 13 of that year.

### A Sketch of an Icon

I am not an artist, let alone an iconographer. I humbly offer this sketch here as a
starting point, a suggestion to you who are more knowledgeable than I, and
more skilled (the bar is low, friends). What is missing or misplaced?

An icon of the Synaxis of the Gospels is not entirely without context or
precedent. Here are icons I had in mind when making this drawing, or that I
have been made aware of since. In each of these, the primary motif is the
centrality of Christ in the communion of His saints.

### Thoughts on Structure

The center of the cosmic hierarchy we find in the Gospels is our God and
Savior, **Jesus Christ**, and, as with other synaxis icons, He is at the center
of my composition. The **Father** is indicated at upper right by the hand
outstretched in blessing, as in the icon of the [Sinful Woman Forgiven by
Christ](/the-twelve-faithful-servants/the-sinful-woman/). In including it in my
drawing, I had in mind the Voice from Heaven at Christ's Baptism, His
Transfiguration, and the Coming of the Hour. The **Holy Spirit** descends in
the form of a dove as at the Baptism.

<p class="half"><a href="./composition.webp"><img src="./composition.webp"></a></p>

Christ came not to bring peace but a sword, to separate out those who believe
in Him from those who do not. In my drawing I represent this fundamental
division with the sweeping curve of the **Seventy Apostles**. Within the arc
they describe is the Kingdom, united with the angelic host and indwelt by God.
Beyond are those who have placed themselves outside, under the sway of
**Satan**. This defines the basic structure of the composition.

#### In the Kingdom

I arranged the individuals within the Kingdom in seven groups, according to the
measure of their faith and devotion as recorded in the Gospels. I tried to be
systematic rather than rhapsodic in the arrangement.

1. The **Deisis**: Christ Himself, supplicated by the Virgin Mary, Mother of
   God, and St. John the Forerunner
1. The **Predecessors** of Christ, by which I simply mean those from
   generations prior to His own, such as Righteous Joseph, and Righteous Simeon
   and Prophetess Anna
1. The **Twelve Apostles**
1. The **Myrrh-bearing Women**
1. The **Faithful Servants**, a name I use for those whom Christ [explicitly,
   directly praises](/the-twelve-faithful-servants/) for their faith
1. Those whose faith is **clear**, though not explicitly, directly praised; for
   example, St. Photini, the Woman at the Well
1. Those whose faith can be **assumed**, though it is not emphasized by the
   Evangelists, such as the Woman Caught in Adultery

There are many wonderful interrelations among these people to explore,
especially among those in the first five groups. Peter and Andrew are brothers.
Peter is an Apostle and also a Faithful Servant. Peter, James, and John are
witnesses to the Transfiguration together. Mary, Martha, and Lazarus of Bethany
are siblings with a close friendship with the Lord. Mary and Martha are
Myrrh-bearers. Mary is a Faithful Servantâ€”the only one praised twice. And so
forth.

I represented children throughout this portion of the drawing, some with their
parents who approach Christ for healing, others gathered directly before
Christ. They are closer almost than the members of the Deisis. "Suffer little
children, and forbid them not, to come unto me: for of such is the Kingdom of
Heaven."

#### Outside

Immediately outside the Kingdom I represented those particular elements of the
natural world that appear in the Gospel stories, such as the wind and the
waves, and the fig tree. Further beyond are the crowds, some individuals of
whom are distinguishable, heckling Christ at various points. At the bottom of
the picture is the outer darkness, reminiscent of the lower portion of the
Golgotha, Resurrection, and Last Judgement icons. Here we find Satan, the
demons, and those such as Herod and Judas who gave themselves over to him. Lord
have mercy.

### Map and Tree

I think of the Synaxis of the Gospels as a map. When I hear a particular story
of an encounter with Christ, I can ask, "Where does this fit?" As I familiarize
myself with this map, I come to know and internalize the Gospels.

It is also a family tree. The individuals in the Synaxis of the Gospels are the
seed of the Church. They number approximately 150 (depending on how we count
certain small groups of individuals, e.g., the Shepherds). The smallest seed
becomes a great spreading tree, "so that the birds of the air may nest under
its shade."

We have some groups represented in the abstract, but an icon primarily represents
concrete individuals. Therefore, figures from the parables are not included:
the members of the Synaxis of the Gospels are historical persons. Each is a
hypostasis. I included a key on the verso in my friend's notebook. (I did,
however, accidentally leave some people out. I would place Moses and Elijah
with the predecessors, as well as the Magi and Shepherds.  [Let me
know](mailto:chad@zetaweb.com) if you find others missing.)

My hope is that the Synaxis of the Gospels can help us more clearly see the
first flush of the communion of saints in the Gospels. I believe these saints
want us to know them better, to follow them as they follow Christ. May those
individuals who encountered Christ in His first coming guide us in our
individualistic age.

If the Synaxis of the Gospels is not of God, may it be rejected and
forgotten. If genuine, may we see this icon emerge within
the Church in God's time.

I happened to be away from home during the 2016 election—I spent two weeks
alone in San Francisco—and it ended up being a
[powerful](https://github.com/gratipay/inside.gratipay.com/issues/867#issuecomment-260093913)
way to experience and mark the event. During the 2020 election this past week,
things lined up for me to once again hit the road, this time for a short
pilgrimage. I started with an overnight backpacking trip, and then I drove out
to St. Tikhon's Monastery.

On the way to St. Tikhon's, I stopped to visit some Amish friends I hadn't seen
in years. One friend in particular caught me up on their community, how it's
been growing, and how issues regularly crop up to threaten their unity.  "In
any community, it seems the Evil One is always looking to sow dissension."

"Yes," I agreed. "Of course, _I_ am never at fault when dissensions arise. It's
others who are the problem."

He allowed a rueful smile. "The older I get, the more it seems like it _is_ my
fault."

I presented the [Twelve Believers](/the-twelve-believers/) to him, those saints
that received Christ's favorable judgement during His First Coming. "How far I
fall short!”

"'Have mercy on me, a sinner.' That's what my old mother prays constantly.”

"Oh? Have you heard of the Jesus Prayer?”

"No, what's that?”

I happened to discover this from [Will
Smith](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nu5g3AiO4U#t=10m22s) soon after I got
back: 

> When we move through the world, you are confronting defiled and degraded
minds, and it's never going to be any different than that. It's the way God
designed this place. You are going to come across people that have made
poisonous conclusions and false beliefs, and they've got insane narratives
running through their minds, and as you walk through the street, you're coming
in contact with that all day long.

> So, in trying to build systems—because that's what's gonna happen now, we're
gonna build new systems, right?—and in building our new systems, you're still
gonna be confronting those same defiled and degraded minds in these
circumstances. The problem isn't completely in the system. The problem is in
the hearts and minds of people. It demands that our attention begin on _our_
hearts and minds.

Yes! May God deepen my prayer even as He redeems the world!

Thankfully, in fact, the Holy and Life-Giving Trinity "designed this place"
precisely for communion—with Him in prayer and with each other in Him—and it is
only our Fall that has led to the brokenness Will describes. It _is_ going to
be "different than that"—definitively at Christ's Second Coming, and
incrementally even now. For through the mystery of God's unfathomable goodness,
He uses even my own feeble, broken attempts "to build systems," through the
prayers of the Mother of God and of all the saints, to bring about the
redemption of the world.

Glory to God!

Turns out the Amish have COVID, and I wasn't sufficiently careful, so now I am
spending two weeks alone in my bedroom. My lack of care has put a significant
strain on my family while I quarantine, with of course a much more serious
impact if I develop symptoms.

Have mercy on me, a sinner. ✠

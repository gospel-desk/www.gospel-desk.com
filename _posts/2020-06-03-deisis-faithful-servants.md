heading: "A Deisis of the Faithful Servants"
excerpt: "Advised by Andrew Gould, I have set the iconographic parameters for the Twelve Believers project."
---

The [Twelve Believers](/the-twelve-believers/) project is a celebration of
those whom Christ celebrates, the fruit of a deep engagement with the Gospels
for the building up of faith in our own day. As I have begun working with
[artists](/updates/2020/first-three-iconographers/) to create new icons of the
Twelve Believers, I have quickly reached the limits of my competence. I am not
fluent enough to properly guide the artistic aspect of the project on my own. 

What is more, while it is a fairly straighforward and ordinary project to
populate a room in one's private home with icons, the iconography for the
Twelve Believers project has a public role to play in establishing an identity
for this group of saints within the life of the Church. The artistic challenge
and opportunity is, as one iconographer put it, "making every single image
function together with the 'team' of other images." If done well, this "will
give a feeling of ensemble and create a stunning impression" of the group as a
whole, increasing the possibility of their reception as such within the Church.

Therefore, I am happy to announce that Andrew Gould, principal designer at [New
World Byzantine](https://newworldbyzantine.com/) and founding editor of the
[Orthodox Arts Journal](https://orthodoxartsjournal.org/), has agreed to join
the Twelve Believers project as my artistic advisor. Under God, Andrew's
guidance will greatly improve the outcome of the iconographic aspect of the
project.


#### Iconographic Parameters

The primary conclusion from my initial conversations with Andrew is that the
icons of the Twelve Believers are to be structured as a deisis, that is, a
representation of Christ in glory following his second coming, with the Mother
of God and John the Baptist in supplication on his right hand and his left.
For example, here is [a
deisis](https://orthodoxartsjournal.org/deisis-an-iconographic-installation/)
from Federico Jos√© Xamist, one of the iconographers working with the Twelve
Believers project. The deisis tier of a traditional iconostasis, particularly a
Russian one, would typically proceed outwards with Archangels Gabriel and
Michael, Saints Peter and Paul, etc. For us instead it will be the Twelve
Believers arrayed down the sides of the
[chapel](/updates/2020/working-on-a-building/), as follows:

<style>
  .deesis {
    width: 1px;
    margin: 12pt auto;
    border-collapse: collapse;
  }
  .deesis td {
    width: 50%;
    white-space: nowrap;
  }
  .deesis td:first-of-type {
    text-align: right;
    padding-right: 36pt;
  }
  .deesis td:last-of-type {
    text-align: left;
    padding-left: 36pt;
  }
  .deesis tr.front td {
    border-bottom: 1px solid #21201A;
  }
  .deesis td.mary {
    padding-right: 9pt;
  }
  .deesis td.john {
    padding-left: 9pt;
  }
  .deesis td.christ {
    text-align: center;
  }
</style>
<table class="deesis">
  <tr>
    <td colspan="2" class="christ">Christ</td>
  </tr>
  <tr class="front">
    <td class="mary">Virgin Mary</td>
    <td class="john">St. John the Baptist</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>St. Mary of Bethany</td>
    <td>St. Justa</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>St. Peter</td>
    <td>St. Veronica</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>St. Nathanael</td>
    <td>The Sinful Woman</td>

    <td>St. Bartimaeus</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Each portrait icon of the Twelve is to be 18 by 24 inches, framed alike, gaze
outward, head inclined towards Christ. Each will vary from its neighbors in
style while remaining equal in artistic mastery, each uniquely evoking the
attraction we ought to feel for these reflections of the image of God. For, in
Andrew's words:

> Icons reveal the beauty of the Kingdom of Heaven to our physical senses,
> inspiring our love of God and His saints by means of eros. Upon seeing a
> great icon, one may feel wounded in the heart by erotic love, and may want to
> skip across the room and kiss it, and never part from that beauty.

The icons at the front will be the largest and most visually sumptuous, with
burnished water gilding and jewel tones, perhaps all on one panel, perhaps on
separate panels of equal height, perhaps hinged in a triptych.

In this context, the Twelve Believers join the Virgin and the Forerunner in
supplication to Christ on our behalf, and we join with this cloud of witnesses
in prayer and worship. Christ holds the text (whether in a book or scroll),
"Well done, good and faithful servants." Of course, Christ himself is the
Faithful Servant, himself explicitly and directly praised by God at his Baptism
and again at his Transfiguration. Likewise, Virgin Mary is praised by Archangel
Gabriel, and John is praised by Christ before the people. The specific words of
praise to each are included on their icon, inscribed in a manner suitable to
each composition:

1. Christ - "This is my beloved Son."
   ([Matthew 17:5](https://www.biblegateway.com/verse/en/Matthew%2017))
1. Virgin Mary - "Blessed art thou among women."
   ([Luke 1:28](https://www.biblegateway.com/verse/en/Luke%201:28))
1. John - "Yes, and more than a prophet."
   ([Matthew 11:9](https://www.biblegateway.com/verse/en/Matthew%2011:9))
1. [St. Justa](/the-twelve-believers/st-justa/) - "Woman, great is your faith!"
1. [St. Veronica](/the-twelve-believers/st-veronica/) - "Daughter, be of good
cheer!" 
1. [The Sinful Woman](/the-twelve-believers/the-sinful-woman/) - "For you loved much."
1. [St. Dismas](/the-twelve-believers/st-dismas/) - "Today you will be with me in Paradise."
1. [The Samaritan Leper](/the-twelve-believers/the-samaritan-leper/) - "None glorified God except this stranger."
1. [St. Bartimaeus](/the-twelve-believers/st-bartimaeus/) - "Receive your sight."
1. [The Centurion](/the-twelve-believers/the-centurion/) - "Not even in Israel have I found such faith."
1. [St. Zacchaeus](/the-twelve-believers/st-zacchaeus/) - "You also are a son of Abraham."
1. [The Wise Scribe](/the-twelve-believers/the-wise-scribe/) - "You are not far from the Kingdom of God."
1. [St. Nathanael](/the-twelve-believers/st-nathanael/) - "An Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile!"
1. [St. Peter](/the-twelve-believers/st-peter/) - "Blessed are you, Simon bar Jonah."
1. [St. Mary of Bethany](/the-twelve-believers/st-mary-of-bethany/) - "She has chosen the good portion."

Surely many more details will need to be decided as the project unfolds, but
the above should give us enough structure to begin in earnest. Thanks be to
God!

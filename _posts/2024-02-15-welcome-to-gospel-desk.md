Greetings! Welcome to Gospel Desk. My purpose here is to participate in the
life of the Orthodox Church. I want to contribute to the Great Commission
through study of the Gospels, the wider Scriptures, and the Fathers. Perhaps I
will engage with contemporary issues. This introductory post offers a sketch 
of my background and the direction of this blog.

### A Little Background 

<div><a href="chadwhitacre.jpg"><img src="/about/chadwhitacre.small.jpg" style="float: left; margin: 0 16pt 16pt 0; width: 33%;"></a></div>

My name is Chad Whitacre. I am an Orthodox Christian, a member of [St.
Nicholas, McKees Rocks](https://orthodoxpittsburgh.org/), a vibrant parish of
the [Orthodox Church in America](https://www.oca.org/) under His Eminence,
[Archbishop Melchisidek](https://www.ocadwpa.org/ourbishop). I was baptized and
raised an Anglican, but growing up, [my dad](https://singinghome.com/) (a
priest and [New Testament scholar](https://whitacregreek.com/)) would remind me
he gave me a pre-Schism saint‚Äôs name in case I ever needed it. [I cashed
it
in](https://www.ancientfaith.com/podcasts/aftodaylive/the_ups_and_downs_of_the_journey_to_orthodox_christianity)
after 43 years, chrismated by the grace of God on February 20, 2022 by [Fr. Tom
Soroka](https://www.ancientfaith.com/contributors/tom_soroka), with [St.
Chad](https://orthochristian.com/101836.html) as my patron and [Dr. Edith
Humphrey](https://edithmhumphrey.com/) as one of my two godparents. Glory to
Jesus Christ!

(Incidentally, the Domesday book of 1086 mentions one of ‚Äú[the
Whitacres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nether_Whitacre),‚Äù which would likely
have lain in the Diocese of Mercia when St. Chad founded its cathedral at
Lichfield in 669. How fun to speculate that my patron was my ancestors‚Äô bishop!
St. Chad, pray for us!)

I started out in my dad‚Äôs footsteps, studying Ancient Languages (Greek and
Hebrew) and Theology at Wheaton College. No-one pays you to read Greek without
a Ph.D., however, and I also inherited a technical bent from my mother, a math
and science teacher. I embarked on [a career in
software](https://chadwhitacre.com/), particularly in Open Source. I do love to
read and write theology, though, and Gospel Desk is an outlet for that.

### Why Gospel Desk?

Studying the Gospels was an important part of my journey to Orthodoxy. I want
to worship and follow the God I find there, to inhabit the world they present,
and to participate in the community they point to, i.e., the Church.

I almost converted to Orthodoxy in college, in about 1998, but stuck with
Protestantism. In time, I asked the question: what does a good defense before
the dread judgement seat of Christ look like? I sought an answer in the
Gospels. For we find there stories of individuals encountering Christ, and each
such meeting is a judgement. The Centurion had faith not found in all Israel,
while the Rich Young Ruler went away sad. In 2008, I determined that St. Justa,
the Canaanite Woman, is the person most successful in surviving the encounter.
I called her the ‚Äúwinner‚Äù of the Gospels. In 2018, I further discovered that
there are exactly twelve individuals whom Christ explicitly praises for their
faith in the Gospels. Imagine! Exactly twelve! Twelve Tribes of Israsel, Twelve
Minor Prophets, Twelve Apostles, Twelve Great Feasts ... and now Twelve Faithful
Servants!? 

This felt worth sharing. I had already published an edition of the Gospels back
in 2010, and I thought I would start a website to promote it, as well as offer
this vision of the [Twelve Faithful Servants](/the-twelve-faithful-servants/).
I settled on the name Gospel Desk to reflect my love of purposeful study,
centered on the Gospels.

However, I didn‚Äôt want to publish an academic paper about the Twelve Faithful
Servants, nor even a book of devotional meditations. I wanted to do something
more. I decided to commission icons. Eventually, I consulted with Andrew Gould
of the [Orthodox Arts Journal](https://orthodoxartsjournal.org/). At one point,
he off-handedly remarked that what I had undertaken was ‚Äújust an Anglican art
project,‚Äù that these were ‚Äúnot truly liturgical objects.‚Äù It‚Äôs not wholly false
to say that I converted to Orthodoxy to prove Andrew wrong. Thanks be to God!

Today, by the grace of God, six icons are completed and in rotation at my
parish. Next week is two years since chrismation. Having read and studied the
Bible for decades as an Anglican, it has been wonderful these past few years to
begin to inhabit the Gospel in the Church, to explore the foothills of the
‚Äúbutter mountain,‚Äù to acquire in small and growing measure the mind of the
Fathers. God willing, with the blessing of my bishop and the guidance of my
priest and my godmother, I am ready to reach a wider audience.

### Themes

My purpose with Gospel Desk is to participate in the life of the Orthodox
Church, both within and beyond my parish. Of course, the [Twelve Faithful
Servants](/the-twelve-faithful-servants/) are part of that, but there is more.
I republished my edition of [_The Gospels_](/the-gospels), and I followed it up
with [a mobile app](/app/). That has put me in touch with [Brian
Glass](https://parochianus.blog/) of [Orthocal.info](https://orthocal.info/), a
project I hope to contribute to. I am working through a patristics reading
plan, which I aim to say more about in [a future
post](https://github.com/gospeldesk/www.gospeldesk.org/issues/29). I already
have one discovery to share, a prayer of St. John of Damascus. More on that, perhaps, in
[another future post](https://github.com/gospeldesk/www.gospeldesk.org/issues/31).

I hope what I write will build up the Church. I‚Äôm not here for an academic
exercise. I want to study with due rigor, yet I want my reading and writing to
be a gift I receive from, and offer back to, God and His Church‚Äînot because you
or God need my amateur scholarship, but because I find a small sum in my hand,
and I want to deposit it with you so that I can at least return it with
interest. ‚Äú[I]t is the conscience of the offerer that sanctifies the sacrifice
when it is pure, and thus moves God to accept the offering as from a friend‚Äù
(St. Irenaeus, _Against Heresies_, 4.16.4). May God in His mercy grant me a
pure conscience that I might make a true offering.

I am motivated by the Great Commission. I want to see the Church thrive and
grow. I am encouraged by my bishop, my priest, my godmother, and my friends. I
trust that God will use what is worthwhile in my efforts to bear fruit, and
that what is unworthy will be corrected or forgotten. Thank you for reading!

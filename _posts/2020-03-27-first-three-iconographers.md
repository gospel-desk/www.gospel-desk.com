[The Twelve Believers](/the-twelve-believers/) is a celebration of the twelve
saints whom Christ directly, explicitly praises in the Gospels. As a major
component of this project, I hope, under God, to commission new icons of each
of the Twelve Believers, from twelve different iconographers. Today I am happy
to announce the first three artists to join the project: Symeon van
Donkelaar, Jonathan Pageau, and Federico Aguirre.


#### Symeon van Donkelaar

Symeon van Donkelaar of [The Conestoga Iconographic
Studio](https://www.conestogaicons.com/) has chosen to paint [St.
Bartholomew](/the-twelve-believers/st-bartimaeus/). Symeon is the first
iconographer I made contact with, after receiving his newsletter last October,
on the Feast of St. Luke, with this call to action:

> If you've thought about commissioning an icon from Conestoga Icons, please
> get in touch before the month of October is finished. Without such interest
> being expressed, the studio's door will have to close for the foreseeable
> future.

I had been sitting by for a while, reading Orthodox Arts Journal and
subscribing to newsletters such as Conestoga's, pondering the possibility of a
series of icons of St. Justa, the Canaanite woman. When I saw Symeon's message,
I was moved to step forward. Conestoga icons have such a distinctive style.
While participating in the iconographic tradition, they embody a particular
vision of the saints that evoke a decidedly modern—almost playful—aesthetic. I
knew I wanted to work together if possible.

Symeon and I entered into a wonderful dialogue that contributed directly to the
birth of Gospel Desk and the Twelve Believers project. Now we are aiming for
late 2020 or early 2021 to realize a new icon of [St.
Bartimaeus](/the-twelve-believers/st-bartimaeus/), the beggar who has so much
to teach us about seeing Christ. Praise be to God!


#### Jonathan Pageau

[Jonathan Pageau](https://pageaucarvings.com/), also a Canadian, is to carve
the [Centurion](/the-twelve-believers/the-centurion/). I knew of Jonathan from
the masthead of the [Orthodox Arts Journal](https://orthodoxartsjournal.org/),
and from his social media presence through [The Symbolic
World](https://thesymbolicworld.com/). I find his exposition of a symbolic,
Biblical worldview to be refreshing and invigorating. We are hopeful that his
work queue and other commitments will allow us to begin working together in
2022.

When presented with an almost clean slate of saints to represent, Jonathan
narrowed the field to the Centurion and St. Mary of Bethany. With Federico also
choosing Mary (see below), the path for Jonathan became clear. Jonathan's
contribution may turn out to be unique in that he is a _carver_ of icons rather
than a painter. Lord willing, the Church will soon have a new stone (or
wooden?) image of the [Centurion](/the-twelve-believers/the-centurion/), the
man of authority who put himself under Christ's authority. May we do the same
with our own lives!



#### Federico Aguirre

Federico Aguirre, known online as [Xamist](https://www.xamist.com/), is the
third iconographer I have connected with, and the first to have drafted an
image. Above you can see his sketch of a new icon of [St. Mary of
Bethany](/the-twelve-believers/st-mary-of-bethany/), the only one of the Twelve
Believers to be praised by Christ more than once: for anointing Christ's head
on one occassion, and for sitting at his feet in adoration on another
occassion. In Federico's words, "Mary shows us that the way to know the Lord is
to spend time with him, to celebrate him."

Federico is a Chilean artist trained in Greece, and a professor at the
Pontifical Catholic University of Chile. As such, his style is a delightfully
Latin American inflection of the Byzantine tradition. The pandemic currently
hinders Federico from accessing his workshop, but, Lord willing, the icon of
Mary can be completed in early 2021.

I am grateful for, and grateful to these first artists who have come together
to celebrate those whom Christ celebrates.  I expect to be able to budget for
three or four icons per year, so we may be able to expand the roster again
soon. I look forward to seeing how the [Twelve
Believers](/the-twelve-believers/) project continues to take shape as various
complementary perspectives are brought together to build faith in our day.

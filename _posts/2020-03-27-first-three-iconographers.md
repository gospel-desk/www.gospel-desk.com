[The Twelve Believers](/the-twelve-believers/) is a celebration of the twelve
saints whom Christ directly, explicitly praises in the Gospels. As a major
component of this project, I hope, under God, to commission new icons of each
of the Twelve Believers, from twelve different iconographers. Today I am happy
to announce the first three artists to accept a commission: Symeon van
Donkelaar, Jonathan Pageau, and Federico Aguirre.


#### Symeon van Donkelaar

Symeon van Donkelaar of [Conestoga Icons](https://www.conestogaicons.com/) has
chosen to paint [St. Bartholomew](/the-twelve-believers/st-bartimaeus/). Symeon
is the first iconographer I made contact with, after receiving his newsletter
last October, on the Feast of St.  Luke, with this call to action:

> If you've thought about commissioning an icon from Conestoga Icons, please
> get in touch before the month of October is finished. Without such interest
> being expressed, the studio's door will have to close for the foreseeable
> future.


I had been sitting by for a while, reading Orthodox Arts Journal and
subscribing to newsletters such as Conestoga's, pondering the possibility of
commissioning a series of icons of St. Justa, the Canaanite woman. When I saw
Symeon's message, I was moved to step forward. Conestoga has such a distinctive
style, evoking Coptic influences yet possessing a decidedly modern—almost
playful—aesthetic. I knew I wanted to work together if possible.

Symeon and I entered into a wonderful dialogue that contributed directly to the
birth of Gospel Desk and the Twelve Believers project. Now we are aiming for
late 2020 or early 2021 to realize a new icon of [St.
Bartimaeus](/the-twelve-believers/st-bartimaeus/), the beggar who has so much
to teach us about seeing Christ. Praise be to God!


#### Jonathan Pageau

[Jonathan Pageau](https://pageaucarvings.com/) is to carve the
[Centurion](/the-twelve-believers/the-centurion/). I knew of Jonathan from the
masthead of the [Orthodox Arts Journal](https://orthodoxartsjournal.org/) and
from his social media presence. Due to Jonathan's work queue and other time
constraints, we don't anticipate working together before 2022.

When presented with an almost clean slate of saints to represent, Jonathan
narrowed the field to the Centurion and St. Mary of Bethany. With Federico also
choosing Mary (see below), the path for Jonathan became clear. Lord willing,
the Church will soon have a new image of the
[Centurion](/the-twelve-believers/the-centurion/), the man of authority who put
himself under Christ's authority. May we do the same!



#### Federico Aguirre

Federico Aguirre, known online as [Xamist](https://www.xamist.com/), is the
third iconographer I have connected with, and the first to have drafted an
image. Above you can see his sketch of a new icon of [St. Mary of
Bethany](/the-twelve-believers/st-mary-of-bethany/), the only one of the Twelve
Believers to be praised by Christ more than once: for anointing Christ's head
on one occassion, and for sitting at his feet in adoration on another
occassion. In Federico's words, "Mary shows us that the way to know the Lord is
to spend time with him, to celebrate him."

Here I must acknowledge the pandemic currently underway, because it prevents
Federico from accessing his workshop. Lord willing, the icon of Mary can be
completed in early 2021.

I am grateful for, and grateful to these first artists who have come together
to celebrate those whom Christ celebrates.  I expect to be able to budget for
three or four icons per year, so we may be able to expand the roster again
soon. I look forward to seeing how the Twelve Believers project continues to
take shape as new perspectives are brought together to build faith in our day.

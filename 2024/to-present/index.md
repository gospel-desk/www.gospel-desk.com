Call me quirky, but I've always loved a good mission statement. A mission
statement is fundamentally a **verb**. I love doing stuff, and a mission
statement tells me what to do.  I don't need to think about it every second of
every day. I need it when I'm at a crossroads, or when I've forgotten why I
have this certain task in front of me.  It helps me complete the task or
abandon it.  A mission statement is a tool for focus. I use it to make
decisions and rouse myself to remember them—that's what it means. 


Fifteen years ago, I pushed the leadership of the Anglican Communion Network to
define our mission. They decided "to **build** a Biblical, missionary, and united
Anglicanism in North America," and [we did](https://anglicanchurch.net/). I
undertook the same at my current employer. We now "**enable** developers to
ship with confidence." When I ran my own startup, our mission was 
"to **cultivate** an economy of gratitude, generosity, and love." I gave up in
2017, and started back towards the Orthodox Church, which already is the
economy of gratitude, generosity, and love.

### My Personal Mission Statement

It was probably also about fifteen years ago that I settled on a _personal_
mission statement. Now that I've been Orthodox for a few years, I'm ready to
recommit to a refined version of it:

> My mission is for us to **present** each other, by the power of the Holy Spirit, as
> pure offerings to God on the Day of Christ. 

It's mostly a distillation of Philippians 2:12-18:

> Therefore, my beloved, as you have always obeyed, not as in my presence only,
> but now much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and
> trembling; for it is God who works in you both to will and to do for His good
> pleasure.
>
> Do all things without complaining and disputing, that you may become
> blameless and harmless, children of God without fault in the midst of a
> crooked and perverse generation, among whom you shine as lights in the world,
> holding fast the word of life, so that I may rejoice in the day of Christ
> that I have not run in vain or labored in vain.
>
> Yes, and if I am being poured out as a drink offering on the sacrifice and
> service of your faith, I am glad and rejoice with you all. For the same
> reason you also be glad and rejoice with me.

I take the Judgement seriously. Each of us will stand before Christ and He will
judge our life. I want to spend my time until then not only growing in union
with God myself, but helping and encouraging you as well. This mission is
equivalent to loving God and my neighbor, fulfilling the commandments of God.

### What It Means Now

Practically speaking, I want to pray for you. I want to get to know you. I want
to have breakfast with you, coffee or a drink. I want to talk together about
our life circumstances and our prayer lives. I want to help you in whatever way
I can. I want to text a little bit, sure, but I really want to be together _in
person_. We're incarnate beings, body and soul. Physical presence strengthens
spiritual connection.

I had a friend, Ed Schroth, who passed away last year. The story of his death
was intertwined with [my dad's](https://singinghome.com/). Ed was a world-class
biology teacher, a mentor to several generations of high school and college
students. I never had him for class. We got to be friends later, through our
Anglican parish. After a couple breakfasts at Eat'n Park, it dawned on me that
Ed had three breakfasts a day, five days a week—or so it seemed—and each one of
us was the only person in the world to him when we were together.

I want to pour myself out, so that on the Last Day I can rejoice when you stand
before Christ and He says to you, "Well done, good and faithful servant!"

Nothing helps with focus like a deadline, and there's no deadline like death.
My own is inching closer. Third quarter, God willing. Middle age. [My dad
died](https://singinghome.com/). Several friends as well. What
matters? What am I about?

I received an answer fifteen years ago, a particular phrase that has stuck with
me: "to present each other as pure offerings to God on the Day of Christ." I
want to be holy, and not holier _than_ thou—holier _with_ thou, by God's grace.

This phrase or intention is mostly distilled from Philippians 2:12-18:

> Therefore, my beloved, as you have always obeyed, not as in my presence only,
> but now much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and
> trembling; for it is God who works in you both to will and to do for His good
> pleasure.
>
> Do all things without complaining and disputing, that you may become
> blameless and harmless, children of God without fault in the midst of a
> crooked and perverse generation, among whom you shine as lights in the world,
> holding fast the word of life, so that I may rejoice in the day of Christ
> that I have not run in vain or labored in vain.
>
> Yes, and if I am being poured out as a drink offering on the sacrifice and
> service of your faith, I am glad and rejoice with you all. For the same
> reason you also be glad and rejoice with me.

We each stand alone at the last. Yet St. Paul indicates that we witness each
other's judgement in some way. He expects to rejoice in _their_ salvation on
the Day of Christ. Now, we are all members of one another. Life is a gift. Our
time is from God. How else to spend it than working out our own salvation,
together?

### Spending Time

It is often said that spending time with friends and family is the true meaning
of life, the thing we can expect, on our deathbed, to wish we had prioritized
more highly. There's truth there. To complete the sentiment, we should
recognize that our relationships are not static. God is working in our lives,
through each other. The time I spend with my loved ones is most valuable when I
am actively working to love them more fully with the love of God, to see them
as God sees them. We might also expand the sentiment to elevate the Divine
Liturgy, time spent with friends and family _in communion with God_.

Love God with all my heart, mind, soul, and strength. Love my neighbor as
myself. Love one another as Christ loved us. Love my wife as Christ loved the
Church. Love my enemies and pray for those who persecute me. This is how I work
out my own salvation with fear and trembling. This doesn't happen online. This
happens in person, face-to-face. This happens in my household, in our house.
This happens in my parish, in our parish hall. This happens at coffee and over
dinner. This happens on the street and in the hospital.

### Nothing Else Matters

At my day job I'm deep in the world of high tech, awash in different visions of
the future and human personhood, competing claims of allegiance. What unites
them all is atheism. DEI. AGI. The singularity. The simulation. Rebuilding
cities. Building new cities. Escaping to space. Accelerating this. Accelerating
that. Chasing dreams. For what? It's all empty. There's no knowledge of God.
There's no prayer. There's no humility. There's no repentance. There's no
self-denial. There's no ascesis. There's no growth in holiness, no escape from
my own sin. There's only swirling mire, crooked and perverse. All is done with
complaining and disputing.

Except when it isn't. The Holy Spirit is everywhere present and fills all
things. As I write, I'm thinking of individuals I encounter in my work that
lift my spirits, that exhibit the fruit of the Spirit. I'm also thinking of
conversations God has brought about in recent years, when I've spent time with
colleagues in person. "So, Chad, what makes you tick? Is it faith?" "So, Chad,
are people religious in Pittsburgh?" "Chad, I've never told this to anyone,
not even my wife."

Making tents is good. Worshiping tents is bad. I want to worship God. I want to
be holy. I want to be present to the people in front of me—physically in front
of me. I want to love them and lay down my life for them. I'm bad at it and I
want to get better every day—every perfect, holy, peaceful, and sinless day. I want
to sharpen and be sharpened, with iron. In the end, I want for us to present
each other—by the power and grace of the Holy Spirit, together with all the
saints and the hosts of heaven—as pure offerings to God on the Day of Christ.
To Him be all glory, honor, and worship, of the Father and of the Son and of
the Holy Spirit, both now and ever and unto the ages of ages! Amen! Lord have
mercy!

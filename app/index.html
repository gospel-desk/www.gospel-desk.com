<p>Life is a story, and God is the author. He is also the protagonist, and yet
He invites me to join in. Reading the Gospels every day powerfully connects my
small story with God's grand Story.</p>

<p>The Gospel Desk App focuses on <u>one story each day</u>, chosen from the
Gospels of Saints Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. The curated selections follow
the <a href="https://www.oca.org/readings">lectionary</a> of the <a
       href="https://www.oca.org/">Orthodox Church in America</a>, a yearly
     cycle connecting you to thousands of years of Tradition and hundreds of
     millions of fellow believers around the world.</p>

<p>Install the Gospel Desk App, and raise your attention heavenward throughout
your day by meditating on the Holy Gospel, according to the rhythms of the
Church's continual pilgrimage toward God.</p>

<p>Let us attend!</p>

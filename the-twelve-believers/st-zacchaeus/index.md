#### In the Gospels

##### Luke 19:1-10

He entered and was passing through Jericho. There was a man named Zacchaeus. He
was a chief tax collector, and he was rich. <u class="blue">He was trying to
see who Jesus was, and couldnâ€™t because of the crowd, because he was short. He
ran on ahead, and climbed up into a sycamore tree to see him, for he was to
pass that way.</u> When Jesus came to the place, he looked up and saw him, and
said to him, <u>Zacchaeus, hurry and come down, for today I must stay at your
house.</u> <u class="blue">He hurried, came down, and received him
joyfully.</u> When they saw it, they all murmured, saying, He has gone in to
lodge with a man who is a sinner.

Zacchaeus stood and said to the Lord, <u class="blue">Behold, Lord, half of my
goods I give to the poor. If I have wrongfully exacted anything of anyone, I
restore four times as much.</u>

Jesus said to him, <u>Today, salvation has come to this house, because he also
is a son of Abraham. For the Son of Man came to seek and to save that which was
lost.</u>

#### In the Gospels

##### Luke 19:1-10

He entered and was passing through Jericho. There was a man named Zacchaeus. He
was a chief tax collector, and he was rich. He was trying to see who Jesus was,
and couldnâ€™t because of the crowd, because he was short. He ran on ahead, and
climbed up into a sycamore tree to see him, for he was to pass that way. When
Jesus came to the place, he looked up and saw him, and said to him, Zacchaeus,
hurry and come down, for today I must stay at your house. He hurried, came
down, and received him joyfully. When they saw it, they all murmured, saying,
He has gone in to lodge with a man who is a sinner.

Zacchaeus stood and said to the Lord, Behold, Lord, half of my goods I give to
the poor. If I have wrongfully exacted anything of anyone, I restore four times
as much.

Jesus said to him, **Today, salvation has come to this house, because he also
is a son of Abraham. For the Son of Man came to seek and to save that which was
lost.**

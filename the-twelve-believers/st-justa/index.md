#### In the Gospels

##### Mark 7:24-30

From there he arose, and went away into the borders of Tyre and Sidon. He
entered into a house, and didn’t want anyone to know it, but he couldn’t escape
notice. For a woman, whose little daughter had an unclean spirit, having heard
of him, came and fell down at his feet. Now the woman was a Greek, a
Syrophoenician by race. She begged him that he would cast the demon out of her
daughter. But Jesus said to her, Let the children be filled first, for it is
not appropriate to take the children’s bread and throw it to the dogs.

But she answered him, <u class="blue">Yes, Lord. Yet even the dogs under the
table eat the children’s crumbs.</u>

He said to her, <u>For this saying, go your way. The demon has gone out of your
daughter.</u>

She went away to her house, and found the child having been laid on the bed,
with the demon gone out.


##### Matthew 15:21-28

Jesus went out from there, and withdrew into the region of Tyre and Sidon.
Behold, a Canaanite woman came out from those borders, and cried, saying, Have
mercy on me, Lord, you son of David! My daughter is severely demonized!

But he answered her not a word.

His disciples came and begged him, saying, Send her away, for she cries after
us.

But he answered, I wasn’t sent to anyone but the lost sheep of the house of
Israel.

But she came and worshiped him, saying, Lord, help me.

But he answered, It is not appropriate to take the children’s bread and throw
it to the dogs.

But she said, <u class="blue">Yes, Lord, but even the dogs eat the crumbs which
fall from their masters’ table.</u>

Then Jesus answered her, <u>Woman, great is your faith! Be it done to you even
as you desire.</u> And her daughter was healed from that hour.

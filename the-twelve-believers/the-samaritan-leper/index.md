#### In the Gospels

##### Luke 17:11-19

It happened as he was on his way to Jerusalem, that he was passing along the
borders of Samaria and Galilee. As he entered into a certain village, ten men
who were lepers met him, who stood at a distance. They lifted up their voices,
saying, Jesus, Master, have mercy on us!

When he saw them, he said to them, Go and show yourselves to the priests. It
happened that as they went, they were cleansed. <u>One of them, when he saw
that he was healed, turned back, glorifying God with a loud voice. He fell on
his face at Jesus’ feet, giving him thanks, and he was a Samaritan.</u> Jesus
answered, **Weren’t the ten cleansed? But where are the nine? Were there none
found who returned to give glory to God, except this stranger?** Then he said
to him, **Get up, and go your way. Your faith has healed you.**

heading: The Twelve Believers
subheading: Celebrating those Christ celebrates
---

[The Gospels](/the-gospels/) tell the story of Jesus, the Son of God, with the
goal that we would submit to His leadership in our lives. What does this
submission look like? In the Gospels, there are twelve people whom Christ
**directly, explicitly praises** for their faith. Just as Jesus calls the
[Twelve
Disciples](https://www.bibleinfo.com/en/questions/who-were-twelve-disciples),
so also there are another Twelve who call on Jesus in a way that provides a
clear picture of devotion for all Christians to follow.

The purpose of the Twelve Believers project is to build faith in our day by
promoting these saints of the Church—producing liturgical art, exploring their
stories, and following them as they follow Christ. Jesus celebrates the Twelve
Believers. Let us celebrate them, as well!


#### Who are the Twelve Believers?

1. [St. Justa](./st-justa/), the Canaanite woman
1. [St. Veronica](./st-veronica/), the woman with a flow of blood
1. [The Sinful Woman](./the-sinful-woman/)
1. [St. Dismas](./st-dismas/), the penitent thief (a.k.a. St. Rakh)
1. [The Samaritan Leper](./the-samaritan-leper/)
1. [St. Bartimaeus](./st-bartimaeus/), the blind beggar
1. [The Centurion](./the-centurion/)
1. [St. Zacchaeus](./st-zacchaeus/), the son of Abraham
1. [The Wise Scribe](./the-wise-scribe/)
1. [St. Nathanael](./st-nathanael/), the true Israelite (a.k.a. St. Bartholomew)
1. [St. Peter](./st-peter/), the blessed
1. [St. Mary of Bethany](./st-mary-of-bethany/), the twice-praised


#### The Structure of the Twelve Believers

1. ##### The Defiant 

   [Justa](./st-justa/), [Veronica](./st-veronica/), and [the Sinful
   Woman](./the-sinful-woman/) are women on the edge of Jewish society, with
   nothing left to lose, who defy onlookers to boldly approach Jesus.

1. ##### The Outcast

   [Dismas](./st-dismas/), [the Samaritan Leper](./the-samaritan-leper/), and
   [Bartimaeus](./st-bartimaeus/) are men without worldly advantages. They beg
   Jesus for mercy and are answered.

1. ##### The Powerful

   [The Centurion](./the-centurion/), [Zacchaeus](./st-zacchaeus/), and [the
   Wise Scribe](./the-wise-scribe/) occupy positions of wealth and status, yet
   they show by their faith that all things are possible with God.

1. ##### The Familiar
   
   [Nathanael](./st-nathanael/), [Peter](./st-peter/), and [Mary of
   Bethany](./st-mary-of-bethany/) are close friends of Jesus. Nathanael and
   Peter are among the Twelve Disciples—indeed Peter is the most prominent
   Disciple—and Mary is a Myrrhbearer and Equal of the Apostles.

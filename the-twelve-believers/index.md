heading: The Twelve Believers
subheading: Celebrating those Christ celebrates
---

[The Gospels](/the-gospels/) tell the story of Jesus, the Son of God, so that
we might submit to His leadership in our lives. What does this submission look
like? There are twelve people whom Christ directly, explicitly praised for
their faith in Him. Just as Jesus called the [Twelve
Disciples](https://www.bibleinfo.com/en/questions/who-were-twelve-disciples),
so also there are Twelve Believers who called on Jesus in a way that provides a
clear picture of devotion for all Christians to follow.

The purpose of the Twelve Believers project is to build faith in our own day by
promoting these saints of the Church, producing liturgical art and exploring
their stories. Jesus Himself celebrated the Twelve Believers. Let us celebrate
them, as well!


#### Who are the Twelve Believers?

1. [St. Justa](./st-justa/), the Canaanite woman
1. [St. Veronica](./st-veronica/), the woman with a flow of blood
1. [The Sinful Woman](./the-sinful-woman/)
1. [St. Dismas](./st-dismas/), the penitent thief
1. [The Samaritan Leper](./the-samaritan-leper/)
1. [St. Bartimaeus](./st-bartimaeus/), the blind beggar
1. [The Centurion](./the-centurion/)
1. [St. Zacchaeus](./st-zacchaeus/), the son of Abraham
1. [The Wise Scribe](./the-wise-scribe/)
1. [St. Nathanael](./st-nathanael/), the true Israelite
1. [St. Peter](./st-peter/), the blessed
1. [St. Mary of Bethany](./st-mary-of-bethany/), the twice-praised


#### The Structure of the Twelve

1. **The Defiant Believers**. [Justa](./st-justa/), [Veronica](./st-veronica/),
   and [the Sinful Woman](./the-sinful-woman/) were women on the edge of Jewish
   society, with nothing left to lose, who defied onlookers to boldly approach
   Jesus.

1. **The Outcast Believers**. [Dismas](./st-dismas/), [the Samaritan
   Leper](./the-samaritan-leper/), and [Bartimaeus](./st-bartimaeus/) were men
   without worldly advantages. They begged Jesus for mercy and were answered.

1. **The Powerful Believers**. [The Centurion](./the-centurion/),
   [Zacchaeus](./st-zacchaeus/), and [the Wise Scribe](./the-wise-scribe/)
   occupied positions of wealth and status, yet they showed by their faith that
   all things are possible with God.

1. **The Familiar Believers**. [Nathanael](./st-nathanael/),
   [Peter](./st-peter/), and [Mary of Bethany](./st-mary-of-bethany/) were
   close friends of Jesus.  Nathanael and Peter were among the Twelve
   Disciples—indeed Peter was the most prominent Disciple—and Mary was a
   Myrrhbearer and Equal of the Apostles.

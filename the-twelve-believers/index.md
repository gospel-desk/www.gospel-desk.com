  <h3>The Twelve Believers</h3>
  <h4>Celebrating those Christ celebrates</h4>
</header>

[The Gospels](/the-gospels/) tell the story of Jesus, the Son of God, so that
we might submit to His leadership in our lives. What does this submission look
like? There are twelve people whom Christ directly, explicitly praised for
their faith in Him. Just as Jesus called the [Twelve
Disciples](https://www.bibleinfo.com/en/questions/who-were-twelve-disciples),
so also there are Twelve Believers who called on Jesus in a way that provides a
clear picture of devotion for all Christians to follow.

The purpose of the Twelve Believers project is to promote these people as
saints of the Church, by exploring their stories and producing liturgical art.
Jesus Himself celebrated the Twelve Believers. Let us celebrate them, as well!


#### Who are the Twelve Believers?

1. [St. Justa](./st-justa/), the Canaanite woman
1. [St. Veronica](./st-veronica/), the woman with a flow of blood
1. [The Sinful Woman](./the-sinful-woman/)
1. [St. Dismas](./st-dismas/), the penitent thief
1. [The Samaritan Leper](./the-samaritan-leper/)
1. [St. Bartimaeus](./st-bartimaeus/), the blind beggar
1. [The Centurion](./the-centurion/)
1. [St. Zacchaeus](./st-zacchaeus/), the son of Abraham
1. [The Wise Scribe](./the-wise-scribe/)
1. [St. Mary of Bethany](./st-mary-of-bethany/), the twice-praised
1. [St. Nathanael](./st-nathanael/), the true Israelite
1. [St. Peter](./st-peter/), the blessed


#### The Structure of the Twelve

1. **The Defiant**. [Justa](./st-justa/), [Veronica](./st-veronica/), and
[the Sinful Woman](./the-sinful-woman/) were women on the edge of Jewish
society, who defied onlookers to boldly approach Jesus with nothing to lose.

1. **The Outcast**. [Dismas](./st-dismas/), [the Samaritan
Leper](./the-samaritan-leper/), and [Bartimaeus](./st-bartimaeus/) were men
without worldly advantages. They begged Jesus for mercy and were answered.

1. **The Powerful**. [The Centurion](./the-centurion/),
[Zacchaeus](./st-zacchaeus/), and [the Wise Scribe](./the-wise-scribe/)
occupied positions of wealth and status, yet they showed by their faith that
all things are possible with God.

1. **The Familiar**. [Mary of Bethany](./st-mary-of-bethany/),
[Nathanael](./st-nathanael/), and [Peter](./st-peter/) were close friends of
Jesus. Nathanael and Peter are among the Twelve Disciples—indeed Peter is the
most prominent Disciple—and Mary is a Myrrhbearer and Equal of the Apostles.

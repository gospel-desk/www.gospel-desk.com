St. John of Damascus published a book called <i>The Fount of Knowledge</i> in
about 750 A.D. It is the crown of the early Fathers, summing up the exposition
and teaching in the centuries after Christ’s first coming, the time of the
Ecumenical Councils.

The book has three parts: on philosophy, on heresy, and on the Orthodox faith.
The third part sets forth the two great dogmas of the Church—the Trinity and
the Incarnation—and then walks through our fall and redemption, and the
flowering of the Church.

The crescendo of the third part is a stunning declaration of the victory of
Christ within our one shared human history and civilization. The Gospel _has_
been preached, idols _have_ been torn down, virtue _has_ been established, and
not through force of arms but by the persuasiveness of unlettered fishermen.
The Damascene writes near Jerusalem while the Holy Land is under the yoke of
Islam, and while the Church is infested with iconoclasm. Yet he can still
celebrate the reality of Christ’s impact. He bursts into prayer!

<div style="padding: 24pt; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 19pt;"><b>Well done, O
Christ</b>, O Wisdom, and Power, and Word of God, and God Almighty! What should
we resourceless people give Thee in return for all things? For all things are
Thine, and Thou askest nothing of us but that we be saved. Even this Thou hast
given us, and by Thy ineffable goodness Thou art grateful to those who accept
it. Thanks be to Thee Who hast given being and the grace of well-being, and Who
by Thy ineffable Condescension hast brought back to this state those who fell
from it.</div>

This prayer—the only prayer in the entire <i>Fount of Knowledge</i>—is the
crown of the crown of the crown of the crown of the crown of the early Fathers.

<div style="padding: 24pt;">
 <div style="padding-left: 35%; padding-bottom: 6pt;">&ldquo;<b>Well done, O Christ!</b>&rdquo;</div>

</div>

This is our effusive response to Christ’s real victory in our actual world, the
pinnacle of Faith reached by ascending from the assessment of all true
philosophy through the refutation of all heresy. This ascent is compiled,
collated, and filtered from all of the earliest Church Fathers from the
Apostles down to the eve of the Seventh Ecumenical Council, by our father among
the saints John of Damascus. In that Council he contributed materially (from
glory) to the eventual Triumph of Orthodoxy. The Kingdom of God is not yet, yet
it is already, in our material world, in our midst. 

How strange, though, for us to address Christ with, &ldquo;Well done!&rdquo; It
can seem inappropriate, as if we were setting ourselves up as a judge over
Christ–God forbid! No: this can only be understood as a response to the,
&ldquo;Well done, good and faithful servant!&rdquo; that we all long to hear.
Indeed, the Greek term (εὖγε) is the same in both instances.

Another of the wonders of this prayer is its laying bare of two parodoxical
realities: God's Grace and our free will. We are "resourceless." We are
dependent on Christ for "all things," including our very "being and the grace
of well-being." Even what Christ asks of us, the one and only thing—"that we be
saved"—He gives us. The _only_ thing that lies with us is whether we "accept"
His gift. Our initial conversion, and each subsequent moment of repentance and
return, is in our hands. Yet every moment leading up to our moments of
repentance, and every moment leading forth, are Christ's. Our repentence is
almost, we might say, a single point, without dimension or content. Christ is
wholly active in bringing us to salvation, and wholly active in carrying us
forward from it. Our bare, stark acceptance is all that is in our
hands—simultaneously everything for us, and yet so close to nothing.

How shocking to learn that Christ is _grateful_ when we accept His salvation!
Perhaps the parable of the Prodigal Son gives us a way to comprehend the
Damascene's spiritual insight. The Father declares, "It is right that we should
make merry and be glad." In the mystery of God's providence, He never forces us
to accept His salvation.  Yet we know that there is joy in the presence of the
angels of God over one sinner who repents. From the Damascene we learn that
Christ Himself shares in—indeed, is the Alpha and the Omega of—this joy, this
gratitude.

O Christ our God, lead us to repentance. Give us Grace to accept. Smash the
idols in our life, in our households and neighborhoods, our cities and nations!
St. John of Damascus, pray for us!


#### Praying with St. John

Surely this prayer is suitable to include in one's private devotions. How else
might it be incorporated into the life of the Church?


#### A Note on Translations

The standard translation of <i>The Fount of Knowledge</i> has been
[Chase's](https://www.cuapress.org/9780813209685/writings/), and this is the
version quoted above (p. 339). SVS Press has published a [new
translation](https://svspress.com/on-the-orthodox-faith-volume-3-of-the-fount-of-knowledge-pps-62/),
but its rendering of the prayer is not as poetic. <a
